DPP courts the immigrant vote for party list election

The DPP held a news event on Monday to campaign to new immigrants. During the event, the Malaysian-born Lo Mei-ling said the DPP had a proven record of pro-immigrant policies. For the 2020 election, Lo was named No. 2 on the DPP's list of legislator-at-large nominees. On Monday, she pointed out that the DPP is the only party to have virtually guaranteed a party list seat to an immigrant representative.

Taking aim at Taiwan’s 530,000 immigrant votes, the DPP held a news conference featuring a Malaysian immigrant who is ranked second on its party list. She and five Southeast Asia immigrants lauded the DPP for its record on minority rights.

DPP legislator-at-large nominee
The DPP’s women’s department created a committee for new immigrants. Over the past few years, the DPP administration has implemented numerous new immigrant policies that have very much made an impact in our community.

I have not returned to the Philippines for a very, very long time, because I love Taiwan. I love living in Taiwan, and so I support Tsai Ing-wen.

For the 2020 party list election, only the DPP has placed an immigrant representative in the so-called safe zone. The KMT’s highest-ranked immigrant candidate is China-born Niu Chun-ju, who is marginalized on the list at No. 17.

As a representative, I may be the only voice representing my community in the nation’s legislature.

With campaign ads in six languages and campaign cars targeting Taiwan’s immigrants, the pan-green camp is canvassing to court diverse populations this election season.
